**Keywords:** ML, LIME, SHAP, AI, SQL
Employee disengagement poses a significant challenge for employers, as skilled and knowledgeable employees are essential for the growth and development of any organization. Every individual within the organization is considered a valuable resource, and companies invest in their training to build their competencies and roles in business. Various factors can impact the level of employee satisfaction, and retaining employees is crucial for every organization since it is linked to job satisfaction. Employee turnover results in substantial costs for companies, making it imperative to retain and sustain employees in the long run to achieve the company's objectives.

To solve the problem of human resource loss, a complex interpretation model is utilized to identify the root cause. Two powerful Explainable AI models, the Shapley Additive Explainer (SHAP) and the Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explainer (LIME), are used to understand the variables. This study also demonstrates how specific factors affect employee happiness and job satisfaction.

An application or website that may evaluate an employee's mood and level of satisfaction. Automatic form generation is possible, and the load ML model uses the data to predict how satisfied an employee is with  their present job.

SVM machine learning model is used which has achieved an accuracy rate of 88% accuracy. XAI ( Explainable artificial intelligence)is used to increase trust by interpreting and providing an explanation of the ML Model's predictions. The project's copyright was secured in 2023.
